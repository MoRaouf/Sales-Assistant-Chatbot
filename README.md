AI-powered sales assistant chatbot that helps sales representatives in answering customer objections. It's developed using **[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)**'s `gpt-3.5-turbo` model, **[LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)** & **[Deep Lake](https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake)** as a Vector Store. It also uses OpenAI **Whisper** model to transcribe audio input, & **Eleven Labs** to generate audio of Chatbot output.
