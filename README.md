# Sales-Assistant-Chatbot ðŸ’¬

AI-powered sales assistant chatbot that helps sales representatives in answering customer objections. It's developed using [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s `gpt-3.5-turbo` model, [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) & [Deep Lake](https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake) as a Vector Store.

The app uses [this](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/handling-common-sales-objections) as a knowledge base, located in the data folder. To use your own knowledge base:

1. Put your knowledge base in the `data` folder in the form of a text file
2. Update the path in `source_data_path` variable in `src/ChatChain.py` to the path of your knowledge base
3. Adjust the `split_data` method in `DeepLake.py` to split your document effectively.
